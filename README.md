# EDA with Big Data : Steam project

Fictive project completed as part of my Data Science Fullstack training at Jedha (Paris).

##  Company's description ðŸ“‡

Steam is a video game digital distribution service and storefront from Valve. It was launched as a software client in September 2003 to provide game updates automatically for Valve's games, and expanded to distributing third-party titles in late 2005. Steam offers various features, like digital rights management (DRM), game server matchmaking with Valve Anti-Cheat measures, social networking, and game streaming services. Steam client's functions include game update automation, cloud storage for game progress, and community features such as direct messaging, in-game overlay functions and a virtual collectable marketplace.

## Project ðŸš§

You're working for Ubisoft, a French video game publisher. They'd like to release a new revolutionary videogame! They asked you conduct a global analysis of the games available on Steam's marketplace in order to better understand the videogames ecosystem and today's trends.
Goals ðŸŽ¯

The ultimate goal of this project is to understand what factors affect the popularity or sales of a video game. But your boss asked you to take advantage of this opportunity to analyze the video game market globally.
