# ANALYSIS OF VIDEO GAME MARKET WITH BIG DATA

Fictive project completed as part of my Data Science Fullstack training at Jedha (Paris).

## Project description üöß

You're working for Ubisoft, a French video game publisher. They'd like to release a new revolutionary videogame! They asked you conduct a global analysis of the games available on Steam's marketplace in order to better understand the videogames ecosystem and today's trends.
Goals üéØ

The ultimate goal of this project is to understand what factors affect the popularity or sales of a video game. But your boss asked you to take advantage of this opportunity to analyze the video game market globally.

## Scope of this project üñºÔ∏è

You'll have to use Databricks and PySpark to conduct this EDA. Particularly, you'll have to use Databrick's visualisation tool to create the visualizations.

The dataset is available in our S3 bucket at the following url: s3://full-stack-bigdata-datasets/Big_Data/Project_Steam/steam_game_output.json.
